Findings
----
- Firewall had broad port access
- Firewall inactive at the OS level
- Some users “might have” unnecessary Sudo rights
- Privileged users do not have MFA enabled


## Recommendations
- Harden firewall rules(SSH, RDP, etc.) at the Azure NSG level
- Enable and harden firewall at the OS level.
- Enforce least privilege – only grant Sudo privileges to users that require it.
- Enforce MFA for privileged users in Azure
