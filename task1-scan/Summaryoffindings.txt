# Task 1 â€“ Recon & Vulnerability Assessment

## Overview
We performed port and vulnerability scans on the Azure-hosted DVWA instance.

## Tools Used
- nmap for port/service discovery
- `tenable` for web server vulnerabilities
- `nikto` for application vulnerability scan

## Key Findings
- SSH service exposed on port 22 with public key auth - Medium
- Missing relevant http headers(x-content-type-options, etc) - Low


## Screenshots & Outputs
